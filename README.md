# Data-Characterization-and-NLR

In the csv.ipynb file you can understand how to create a path for multiple csv files using Pandas Libraries, read those data files and merge them into one file
Once merged and loaded, you can then organize your data, give column names, characterize data according to your needs
Merged.csv is your final saved csv file

The Non_linear_regresssion.ipynb file is an example of how to carry out Logarithmic Regression on your data and predict new values according to curve fitting
You can then calculate the variance R^2 and understand how close the data is to the fitted regression line
